Start 17:19

00:33 - 17:52 add wheels.
01:18 - 19:10 change springs and mass center.
03:11 - 22:21 rotating wheels (there must be stop light to rotate wheels...)

Start 08:45
03:03 - 11:42 lights and shades on btr80
		YOU MUST SET TO YES DYNAMIC SHADOWS IN MATERIAL PROPERTIES!

Start 12:47
xx:xx - xx:xx bug with rear lights/wheel rotations
	WheeledVehicle::advanceTime not called when player is in vehicle.
	It is not called in T3D/std/stdGameProcess.cpp:162
	(StdClientProcess:advanceTime).
	What happens when i enter car?

start 19:48, 02.05.2017
03:12 - 23:00, debugging, nothing found (except that Vehicle::mountObject
	calls ShapeBase::onMount, and SceneObject::mountObject is called
	twice). mDataBlock->onMount_callback (player data block) is ok.
	for (CollisionWorkingList *itr = mConvex..) in Vehicle.cpp has
	nothing with ProcessList.
 	
start 09:00, 03.05.2017
04:44 - 13:44, closer debug of ProcessList and ProcessObject.
		Where does something removes anything from ProcessList/
		mProcessLink?

		ProcessList::advanceObjects.
			What list.plLinkBefore(mHead.mProcessLink.next) does?
				Inserts list ProcessObject before mHead.mProcessLink.next.
				list is temporary. 
			What mHead.plUnlink(); does?
				Removes mHead from it's own list.
				(mHead unlinked -now it's nowhere).
			loop:
			In loop we unlink from previous list to mHead again.

			Can not loop over mHead list (error).

		ProcessList::advanceTime
			PreTickSignal?
			mPreTick.trigger()?

		ProcessObject::plJoin - ok
		ProcessObject::plLinkBefore - ?
		ProcessObject::plLinkAfter - ?
		ProcessObject::plUnlink - ?

		btr is removed from mHead list of StdClientProcessList.

		ANSWER: SceneObject::setProcessTick(bool t) CAUSES IT!!!
		By why someone would like to BTR->setProcessTick(false)?
		
start 13:45, 03.05.2017
01:52 - 15:37 - Why whould somebody BTR->setProcessTick(false) on vehicle enter?
		We (client) are controlling the vehicle	and mProcessTick may be used to distinguish it.
		Each object is either advanced a single tick, or if it's
		being controlled by a client, ticked once for each pending move.

	
		Why getMountedObjectCount() returns 0 when no lights?
		On enter:
		Player::setControlObject -> ShapeBase::setControllingObject -> 
		SceneObject->setProcessTick(false) (player should be mounted already)

		SceneObject::mountObject mounts objects (increments mMount count).

		How player enters car:
		serverCmdmountVehicle
			Vehicle::mountObject(player, node)
				SceneObject::mountObject(player, node)
					player->mMount gets updated.
					vehicle->mMount also.
					what with 1085 - 1099?
					Player/ShapeBase::onMount(vehicle, node)
						GameBase::onMount(vehicle, node)
							mDataBlock->onMount_callback 
							== PlayerData::onMount
								player.setControlObject(vehicle)!
								Player::setControlObject
									Vehicle/
									ShapeBase::setControllingObject
														SceneObject::setProcessTick(false)

		Answer: Problem is with Player::readPacketData and setControlObject,
			which is called twice. 
			player->mMount and vehicle->mMount are not updated on client.

start 17:00, 03.05.2017
xx:xx - xx:xx - repair it.
		replace setControlObject(obj) with obj->mountObject(this, 0)
		in Player::readPacketData?
		Well, it works, but is it ok?
		mMount gets updated so now wheels rotate.
		But will it be unmounted/undone properly?

		Problem 1: unmounting from vehicle.
		It's seems to be very messy.
					
xx:xx - xx:xx again change spring and mass centre.
